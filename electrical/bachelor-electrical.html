All of the courses are presented at once a year, and some of the elective courses are offered for every semester. </p>
			            		<br>
			            		<p class="normal">Interactions with students: Several ways are conducted to interact between faculty and students. The faculty interacts closely with the students by face-to-face meeting in classroom or meeting in the faculty room. Interaction can also be done through online media such as e-mail, Learning Management System (LMS), social media, and special social media application groups. The interactions are usually done in relation to the assignment of the course, faculty as academic advisor, as a supervisor: undergraduate research and field study, student activities i.e robotic contest.</p>
			            		<br>
			            		<p class="normal">University service activities: The service activities carried out by the faculty are extensive, both on campus and off campus. Some faculty members become members of the university division. Also some faculty members participate in various committees for university or faculty activities, participate in coaching student activities such as robot contests, student creativity programs, and others. In addition, participation is also conducted outside the campus to serve the community. Community service in the form of: Procurement and counseling on how to obtain clean water for people in areas that are difficult to get clean water. Engaged in electricity-saving education programs and the use of solar panels for locations that have not installed electricity services by the government.</p>
			            		<br>
			            		<p class="normal">Professional development: Professional development for faculty members is regularly carried out. A faculty is required to take apart in the course design and pedagogical techniques training such as Instructional Technique for Basic Skills Improvement Training and Applied Approach Training. Some of the trainings are also attended by faculty members such as training on: the research proposal preparation, the strategy to penetrate international scientific journal publications, and the research output utilization with potential for patents. In addition to professional developments, the faculty members also build effective network with others lecturer in both domestic and abroad through post graduated program in foreign universities, national and international conferences, the program of scheme for academic mobility and exchange (SAME) in foreign universities.</p>
			            		<br>
			            		<p class="normal">Interactions with industrial and professional practitioners including employers of students: Some of the faculty members are actively involved in solving industrial problems, and conducting collaborative research such as with electric utility and cement companies. The EESP is regularly invited representatives from industry as guest lecturers in undergraduate classes to give public lectures to broaden the students understanding of current industrial context.</p>

			            		<p class="normal">Faculty members at the EESP have responsibility related to academic program in electrical engineering which is approved by faculty. Besides semester evaluation, every five years, faculty members evaluate / review the implementation of academic program as a whole including such us program goals, curriculum, student ratings, and equipment resources. The review is intended to know the implementation level of the academic program so it can be used as a reference in designing the next academic program. If there are big changes such as deleting or adding new course, then it is proposed to department and forwarded to faculty for final approval. Faculty members have authority for course modifications.</p>

			            <p class="normal">The main structure of the curriculum is shown by Figure 1-1. In the first 4 (four) semesters, freshmen and sophomores spend most of their time in classrooms and supporting teaching laboratories to develop their knowledge on required mathematics and basic sciences (physics and chemistry), and the Electrical Engineering fundamentals, especially the 4 (four) basics namely1: (1) Electric Circuits, (2) Electro-magnetics, (3) Solid-state Electronics and (4) Digital Logic Circuits. They also begin to develop their skills to conduct simple experiments, to analyze, interpret and present data, to enhance their knowledge on the required subjects.</p>
			            <p class="normal">After completing all basic and fundamental courses, in the third year the students are supposed to take at least one elective-course package per semester consisting of 3 to 4 courses in a specific area of electrical engineering that will - but not necessarily - lead  to one of the research laboratories or working groups in the fourth year that they are interested to apply. Roughly 6 to 8 elective-course packages are offered each semester to juniors, covering the total of more than 50 elective-courses. </p>
			            <br>
			            <p class="normal">Beginning in the fifth semester, a junior should make a decision to choose at least one of the following 5 (five) options by solicitedly selecting the related package of elective courses:</p>
			            <br>
			            <ul class="c">
			            	<li class="normal">Option 1: Electrical Power Engineering and Electricity</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 2: Telecommunication Engineering and Information Systems</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 3: Computer Engineering and Robotics</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 4: Control Systems and Instrumentation</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 5: Electronic Engineering</li>
			            </ul>
			            <br>
			            <p class="normal">The ultimate learning process is at the final fourth year. Seniors are required to apply to one of the research laboratories or working groups. When a senior is admitted to a research laboratory or working group then he or she becomes a member of the laboratory or group by signing an annual contract with the head of the laboratory or the chairman of the group. The seniors will work together with professors and their associates and assistants, their fellows graduate and undergraduate students, to develop their ability to apply their knowledge and to design experiments, systems, processes and/or components to meet desired needs. They also learn how to work effectively not only as individuals but also in teams, either as leaders or members.</p>
