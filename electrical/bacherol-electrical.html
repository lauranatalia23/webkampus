			            		<p class="normal">Faculty members at the EESP have responsibility related to academic program in electrical engineering which is approved by faculty. Besides semester evaluation, every five years, faculty members evaluate / review the implementation of academic program as a whole including such us program goals, curriculum, student ratings, and equipment resources. The review is intended to know the implementation level of the academic program so it can be used as a reference in designing the next academic program. If there are big changes such as deleting or adding new course, then it is proposed to department and forwarded to faculty for final approval. Faculty members have authority for course modifications.</p>

			            <p class="normal">The main structure of the curriculum is shown by Figure 1-1. In the first 4 (four) semesters, freshmen and sophomores spend most of their time in classrooms and supporting teaching laboratories to develop their knowledge on required mathematics and basic sciences (physics and chemistry), and the Electrical Engineering fundamentals, especially the 4 (four) basics namely1: (1) Electric Circuits, (2) Electro-magnetics, (3) Solid-state Electronics and (4) Digital Logic Circuits. They also begin to develop their skills to conduct simple experiments, to analyze, interpret and present data, to enhance their knowledge on the required subjects.</p>
			            <p class="normal">After completing all basic and fundamental courses, in the third year the students are supposed to take at least one elective-course package per semester consisting of 3 to 4 courses in a specific area of electrical engineering that will - but not necessarily - lead  to one of the research laboratories or working groups in the fourth year that they are interested to apply. Roughly 6 to 8 elective-course packages are offered each semester to juniors, covering the total of more than 50 elective-courses. </p>
			            <br>
			            <p class="normal">Beginning in the fifth semester, a junior should make a decision to choose at least one of the following 5 (five) options by solicitedly selecting the related package of elective courses:</p>
			            <br>
			            <ul class="c">
			            	<li class="normal">Option 1: Electrical Power Engineering and Electricity</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 2: Telecommunication Engineering and Information Systems</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 3: Computer Engineering and Robotics</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 4: Control Systems and Instrumentation</li>
			            	<li class="normal">Option 5: Electronic Engineering</li>
			            </ul>
			            <br>
			            <p class="normal">The ultimate learning process is at the final fourth year. Seniors are required to apply to one of the research laboratories or working groups. When a senior is admitted to a research laboratory or working group then he or she becomes a member of the laboratory or group by signing an annual contract with the head of the laboratory or the chairman of the group. The seniors will work together with professors and their associates and assistants, their fellows graduate and undergraduate students, to develop their ability to apply their knowledge and to design experiments, systems, processes and/or components to meet desired needs. They also learn how to work effectively not only as individuals but also in teams, either as leaders or members.</p>

			        	<p class="normal">All academic teaching and learning processes are located in the new Faculty of Engineering campus at Gowa, about 20 km to the south from the old campus at Tamalanrea, Makassar. The new campus is designed to accommodate the concept of Laboratory-based Education (LBE) adopted by the Faculty of Engineering. Common facilities such as classrooms, the central library and the Faculty of Engineering administrative offices, are located in the main area of campus. A three-story building as seen in Fig. 1-2 is functioned as the Classroom Building to house classrooms with the capacity of 20 to 100 students. Lecture theaters for an audience of hundreds of students are also available for general lectures. For smaller classes, less than 20 students, the seminar and meeting rooms in laboratories at the Electrical Engineering Building can be used, as shown in Fig. 1-3</p>
